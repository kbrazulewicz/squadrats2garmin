Contact me if your country/province is missing.

## Generating your own grid
You can generate your own grid using this project. 
This will require knowledge of `git`, `Python` `bash` and access to a Linux or macOS computer. 
```shell
# install mkgmap tool
$ sudo apt install mkgmap

# clone the repository
$ git clone git@github.com:kbrazulewicz/squadrats2garmin.git
$ cd squadrats2garmin

# setup Python environment
$ python3 -m venv .venv
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

# activate Python environment
$ source .venv/bin/activate
```

Garmin-compatible grids are created by running `squadrats2garmin` script, passing a configuration file as an argument, ie.
```shell
# run the script
$ ./squadrats2garmin.sh config/PL-Polska.json
```
Read more about [configuration file format](config/README.md)
